## 🛡️ Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it responsibly.

### 🚫 Do NOT Open a Public Issue

Please do **not** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.

Public disclosure before a fix is available may put users at risk.

---

### ✅ Preferred Reporting Method

Please report security vulnerabilities by:

1. Going to the repository’s **Security** tab.
2. Selecting **"Report a vulnerability"** (if GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting is enabled).

If Private Vulnerability Reporting is not available, please contact the maintainer directly through GitHub and clearly mark your message as:

> **Security Vulnerability Report**

When submitting a report, include:

- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- The potential impact
- Any proof-of-concept code or screenshots (if applicable)
- Your GitHub username for follow-up (optional)

---

## ⏱️ Response Process

After a vulnerability is reported:

1. You will receive an acknowledgment within a reasonable timeframe.
2. The issue will be investigated and validated.
3. A fix will be developed and tested.
4. A patch release will be published.
5. The vulnerability will be publicly disclosed after a fix is available.

---

## 🤝 Responsible Disclosure

We ask that you:

- Give maintainers reasonable time to investigate and fix the issue before public disclosure.
- Avoid exploiting the vulnerability beyond what is necessary to demonstrate the issue.
- Act in good faith to protect the security and privacy of users.

---

## 📦 Third-Party Dependencies

StagePro relies on third-party libraries (such as Python packages and Qt bindings).  
If a vulnerability is discovered in an upstream dependency, fixes may depend on updates from that project.

Security updates will be applied as soon as practical once upstream patches are available.

---

## ⚖️ Scope

This policy applies to:

- The core StagePro application
- Official releases and build artifacts
- Repository-hosted code

This policy does not apply to:

- Unofficial forks
- User-modified builds
